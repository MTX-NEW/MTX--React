How It Works
User Types and User Groups:
User types define the roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer) that can be assigned to users. User groups are collections of users that can share permissions.
A user can belong to a user group, and that group can be associated with one or more user types.
Page Permissions:
Page permissions are set based on user types. For each page, you can define whether a user type can view or edit that page.
This means that if a user belongs to a user group that is linked to a user type with specific page permissions, they will inherit those permissions.
